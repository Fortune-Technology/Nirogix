# testcases.md — Nirogix manual QA checklist

The complete manual test pass for the platform, organised by module. A tester who has never seen the code should be able to execute any case here from the steps alone.

**This file is maintained with the code, not at the end.** A new page, workflow, endpoint, component, validation, permission, or behaviour adds its cases in the same change; changed behaviour updates them; removed behaviour deletes them; a change that can affect existing functionality adds regression cases (`resources/rules.md` → Manual Test Cases). Automated tests do not replace this file, and this file does not replace automated tests.

## How to read a case

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **ID** | `MODULE-nn`, stable — referenced from bug reports |
| **Priority** | P1 blocks release · P2 important · P3 cosmetic/edge |
| **Type** | Functional · Security · Validation · UI/UX · Responsive · Accessibility · Integration · Regression |
| **Role** | The user the case must be run as |
| **Status** | Not run · Pass · Fail · Blocked · N/A — reset each release |

## Test environment & accounts

- **Portal** `http://localhost:3000` · **Marketing** `http://localhost:3001` · **API** `http://localhost:4000/api/v1` (Swagger at `/api/v1/docs`).
- Seeded demo tenants: **CITYCARE**, **SUNRISE**, plus the vendor tenant **PLATFORM**.
- Accounts (seed, password `ChangeMe#123`): `owner@takoriya.example` (super_admin, PLATFORM) · `admin@citycare.example` (org_admin) · `reception@citycare.example` (receptionist) · plus doctor / pharmacist / lab / cashier users per the seed.
- Run each UI case in **Light and Dark**, and at least once at **mobile width (375px)** and desktop.
- **Status legend below is per release.** Everything currently reads *Not run* — this checklist has not yet been executed end to end by a tester.

## 1. Authentication & session

| ID | Case | Preconditions | Steps | Expected result | Priority | Type | Role | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| AUTH-01 | Sign in with valid credentials | Seeded tenant | Open `/login` → enter org code `CITYCARE`, email, password → Sign in | Lands on `/dashboard`; sidebar shows only permitted modules; no toast is raised | P1 | Functional | org_admin | Not run |
| AUTH-02 | Sign in with a wrong password | — | Same, with a wrong password | Inline error "Invalid credentials" on the form; **no** toast (the form owns this message); user stays on `/login` | P1 | Functional | any | Not run |
| AUTH-03 | Sign in with an unknown org code | — | Org code `NOSUCHORG` + valid email/password | Inline error; no hint about whether the email exists | P1 | Security | any | Not run |
| AUTH-04 | Password field reveal | — | Focus password → press the eye toggle | Password becomes readable, toggles back; control is keyboard reachable | P3 | Accessibility | any | Not run |
| AUTH-05 | Session survives a reload | Signed in | Press F5 on `/patients` | Page reloads still signed in (silent refresh); no flash of the login screen | P1 | Functional | any | Not run |

| MKT-06 | Portal is not indexable | — | Open the Portal's `/robots.txt` and page source | `Disallow: /` and `noindex, nofollow`; no tenant or patient data in any metadata | P1 | Security | anonymous | Not run |
| MKT-07 | Content guardrails | — | Read pricing, security, home | No prices, no certification claims, no invented customers or testimonials, no popularity badge | P1 | Functional | anonymous | Not run |
| MKT-11 | Every module states its availability | — | Open `/modules` and the home module bento | Each card carries a Built or Planned badge; the release note explains what the statuses mean; nothing implies the whole catalogue is usable | P1 | Functional | anonymous | Not run |
| MKT-12 | A module page separates today from planned | — | Open `/modules/pharmacy` | "What it does today" lists only shipped behaviour; planned PRD scope sits in its own labelled block; the two never mix | P1 | Functional | anonymous | Not run |
| MKT-13 | Integrations are honest | — | Open `/integrations` | ICD-10 and SMS/email are Built; FHIR APIs, SNOMED/LOINC, DICOM, ABDM, WhatsApp, gateway and Tally are Planned; the FHIR entry distinguishes the modelled core from the unbuilt APIs | P1 | Functional | anonymous | Not run |
| MKT-14 | Security separates enforced from committed | — | Open `/security` | Each practice is tagged Enforced today or Commitment; hosting reads as a design commitment; the alignment note rules out certification, audit and accreditation | P1 | Functional | anonymous | Not run |
| MKT-15 | Claim spot-check against the product | Portal running | Pick five claims at random from any marketing page and try them in the Portal | Each either works as described or is labelled planned; anything else is a defect, not a copy tweak | P1 | Functional | org_admin | Not run |
| MKT-08 | Theme toggle | — | Switch Light/Dark; reload | Choice persists; no flash of the wrong theme on load | P2 | UI/UX | anonymous | Not run |
| MKT-09 | Contact form | — | Submit the demo form | Confirmation state shown. **Known limitation: the form does not transmit yet** (`BACKLOG.md` U-2) | P1 | Functional | anonymous | Not run |
| MKT-10 | Back to top & smooth scroll | Long page | Scroll down, press Back to top | Smooth return to top; routes always open scrolled to the top | P3 | UI/UX | anonymous | Not run |
| MKT-16 | The product is called Nirogix | — | Read the header, footer, titles, legal pages and OG cards | Nirogix everywhere the product is named; "HMS" appears only as the industry term in search-intent copy, never as our name | P1 | Functional | anonymous | Not run |
| MKT-17 | The brand mark renders | — | Check the marketing header and footer, a browser tab, and an OG card; then the Portal's login card and app shell | The N monogram appears at each place — no stray letter from the old name, no blank tile, no default framework favicon. It follows the accent in Light and Dark, and a tenant's own logo replaces it in the Portal where one is uploaded | P2 | UI/UX | anonymous | Not run |

## 16b. Environments & domains (ADR-042, `resources/domains.md`)

Run at staging bring-up and again before each production release. Every case here fails the release if it fails.

| ID | Case | Preconditions | Steps | Expected result | Priority | Type | Role | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DOM-01 | Every host resolves over TLS | DNS + certificates in place | Open each production and staging host | All load over HTTPS with a valid `*.nirogix.com` certificate; no browser warning, no IP or provider hostname anywhere | P1 | Functional | anonymous | Not run |
| DOM-02 | `www` redirects to the apex | Production | Request `https://www.nirogix.com/pricing` | 301 to `https://nirogix.com/pricing`; `www` never serves content | P1 | Functional | anonymous | Not run |
| DOM-03 | Canonicals match the environment | Staging and production | Compare `<link rel=canonical>`, sitemap URLs and JSON-LD `url` on each | All use that environment's own origin; staging never emits a production URL | P1 | Functional | anonymous | Not run |
| DOM-04 | Staging is not indexable | Staging | Fetch any staging page and `/robots.txt` | `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow` on the response and access control in front; the staging site cannot be reached anonymously | P1 | Security | anonymous | Not run |
| DOM-05 | CORS allowlist is environment-specific | Any deployed API | Call the API with `Origin: https://evil.example`, then with that environment's Portal origin | The first is refused, the second allowed; no wildcard reflected, and no production origin listed in staging | P1 | Security | anonymous | Not run |
| DOM-06 | The refresh cookie is host-only | Deployed Portal | Sign in and inspect the cookie | `Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax` with **no** `Domain` attribute, on the API host only; it is never sent to the marketing or Portal host | P1 | Security | any | Not run |
| DOM-07 | Staging cannot reach production data | Staging | Check the database URL, R2 bucket and notification sender in use | Each is the staging one; a staging session cannot authenticate against production | P1 | Security | super_admin | Not run |
| DOM-08 | Swagger UI is closed in production | Production | Open `/api/v1/docs`, then `/api/v1/openapi.json` | The interactive UI is not served; the JSON spec is | P2 | Security | anonymous | Not run |
| DOM-09 | No hard-coded host | Repository | Grep the apps for `nirogix.com` | Only configuration, documentation and comments match — never application logic | P2 | Functional | any | Not run |

## 17. Specializations (marketing)

| ID | Case | Preconditions | Steps | Expected result | Priority | Type | Role | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SPC-01 | Index lists every specialty | — | Open `/specialties` | All specialties render; the six featured ones link to their own page | P1 | Functional | anonymous | Not run |
| SPC-02 | Featured specialty page | — | Open `/specialties/cardiology` | Challenges, platform support, modules, configuration and related specialties all render | P1 | Functional | anonymous | Not run |
| SPC-03 | Non-featured specialty has no page | — | Open `/specialties/oncology` | 404 — no thin auto-generated page exists | P2 | Functional | anonymous | Not run |
| SPC-04 | Specialty SEO | — | Check title/description/canonical on a specialty page | Intent-matched ("Hospital Management Software for Cardiology"), unique per specialty | P2 | Functional | anonymous | Not run |
| SPC-05 | Honest claims | — | Read any specialty page | States that specialties differ in configuration, not code; no claim of a specialty-specific module | P1 | Functional | anonymous | Not run |
| SPC-06 | Navigation entry | — | Desktop nav and mobile bar | Specialties is reachable from both | P2 | UI/UX | anonymous | Not run |

## 18. Cross-cutting: accessibility, theming, performance

| ID | Case | Preconditions | Steps | Expected result | Priority | Type | Role | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A11Y-01 | Keyboard-only operation | — | Complete sign-in → patient search → open a record using only the keyboard | Every control is reachable, focus is always visible, no trap outside dialogs | P1 | Accessibility | any | Not run |
| A11Y-02 | Screen-reader announcements | Screen reader on | Trigger a success and an error toast | Success announces politely, error assertively | P2 | Accessibility | any | Not run |
| A11Y-03 | Contrast | — | Check text on surfaces in both themes | Meets WCAG AA | P2 | Accessibility | any | Not run |
| A11Y-04 | Reduced motion | OS setting on | Navigate, open drawers and toasts | Animations collapse to static; nothing becomes unusable | P3 | Accessibility | any | Not run |
| THEME-01 | Dark mode across the app | — | Toggle Dark and walk the main screens | Every surface, table, toast, drawer and dialog is readable; no white flash | P1 | UI/UX | any | Not run |
| THEME-02 | Tenant accent | Custom brand colour set | Walk the Portal | Buttons, links, badges, active nav and table accents all follow the tenant colour | P2 | UI/UX | org_admin | Not run |
| BRD-05 | The accent survives interaction | Custom brand colour set (e.g. deep purple) | Hover and press the primary button, a row action, and the back-to-top control | Hover and pressed states are shades of the tenant colour, never the default teal; the focus ring follows it too | P1 | UI/UX | org_admin | Not run |
| BRD-06 | Back to top follows the brand on both surfaces | Portal with a tenant accent; marketing with a platform-branding override | Scroll each site and inspect the button in Light and Dark | The Portal button uses the tenant accent, the marketing button the marketing accent; neither shows the other's colour or a hardcoded teal | P1 | UI/UX | org_admin | Not run |
| BRD-07 | Shared components on the marketing site | Marketing site | Open the bottom nav, the drawer and a toast in both themes | All follow `--mk-accent` and the marketing surfaces, not the Portal defaults | P2 | UI/UX | anonymous | Not run |
| PERF-01 | Core Web Vitals | Throttled mid-range mobile | Lighthouse on the marketing home and a Portal list page | LCP ≤2.5s, INP ≤200ms, CLS ≤0.1. **Not yet measured — see `BACKLOG.md`** | P2 | Functional | any | Not run |

| PRF-02 | Same screen for every role | — | Repeat as receptionist, doctor, org_admin | One screen throughout; only the values differ | P2 | UI/UX | any | Not run |
| PRF-03 | Rename yourself | Signed in | Change Full name, Save | Success toast; the topbar name updates without a reload; the change survives a reload | P1 | Functional | any | Not run |
| PRF-04 | Cancel discards the edit | Signed in | Type a new name, press Cancel | Field reverts; Save is disabled until something actually changes | P2 | UI/UX | any | Not run |
| PRF-05 | Email is not self-editable | Signed in | Attempt to edit Email | Read-only, with an explanation | P2 | Security | any | Not run |
| PRF-06 | Change password, happy path | Signed in | Enter current + a new password twice, submit | Signed out and returned to `/login`; the new password works, the old one does not | P1 | Security | any | Not run |
| PRF-07 | Wrong current password | Signed in | Enter a wrong current password | Rejected; password unchanged; the message does not reveal which field was wrong | P1 | Security | any | Not run |
| PRF-08 | New password too short / mismatched | Signed in | Enter 9 characters, then two different values | Blocked client-side with a field-level message; no request sent | P2 | Validation | any | Not run |
| PRF-09 | Reusing the current password | Signed in | Set the new password to the current one | Rejected with a clear message | P2 | Security | any | Not run |

| PRF-11 | Cannot edit another user | Signed in | Call `PATCH /auth/profile` with another user's id in the body | Ignored — the endpoint acts only on the token's user | P1 | Security | any | Not run |
| PRF-12 | Password manager works | — | Sign in, then change the password | The browser offers to save at sign-in and to update after the change (no `autocomplete="off"` anywhere) | P2 | UI/UX | any | Not run |

## 20. Error pages & rate limiting

| ID | Case | Preconditions | Steps | Expected result | Priority | Type | Role | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 404-01 | Portal 404 | Signed in | Open `/does-not-exist` | Branded Portal 404 with a dashboard CTA, using design-system tokens and Lucide icons — never a browser error page | P2 | UI/UX | any | Not run |
| 404-02 | Marketing 404 | — | Open `/does-not-exist` on the marketing site | Branded 404 with Back-to-home, Book-a-demo and the section links | P2 | UI/UX | anonymous | Not run |
| 404-03 | 404s are not indexed | — | Inspect both 404 pages' robots metadata | `noindex`; the marketing one keeps `follow` so crawlers can leave via the links | P3 | Functional | anonymous | Not run |
| RATE-01 | Login brute force is throttled | `RATE_LIMIT_IN_DEV=true` | Fail sign-in 11 times within 15 minutes | The 11th is refused with 429 and the shared toast, not another credential check | P1 | Security | anonymous | Not run |
| RATE-02 | Successful logins are not penalised | Same | Sign in and out repeatedly | Never throttled — only failures consume the allowance | P2 | Functional | any | Not run |
| RATE-03 | Password-change throttling | Same | Submit the change form 21 times in 15 minutes | Refused with 429 | P2 | Security | any | Not run |
| CORS-01 | Cross-origin is refused in production | Production build with `CORS_ORIGINS` set | Call the API from an origin outside the allowlist | Browser blocks it; the server logs the refused origin | P1 | Security | anonymous | Not run |

## Coverage gaps (deliberate, tracked)

These are known and recorded in `BACKLOG.md` rather than silently missing:

- **Automated frontend tests do not exist yet** — no unit, component or end-to-end suites in `hms_frontend`, `marketing`, `@hms/ui`, or `@hms/utils`. The backend has Vitest suites (auth, RBAC, tenancy, audit, admin, appointments, branding, events, jobs). Until the frontend suites exist, every UI case above is manual-only, which is a risk this file makes visible rather than hides.
- **Not yet buildable as cases:** password reset / email invite, MFA challenge, branch switching, break-glass — the features are not implemented.
- **Staging-only cases** (real SMS/WhatsApp send, deploy pipeline, backup restore drill) are blocked on infrastructure.
